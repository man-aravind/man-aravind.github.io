  title={Coupling induced logical stochastic resonance},
  author={Aravind, Manaoj and Murali, K and Sinha, Sudeshna},
  abstract ={In this work we will demonstrate the following result: when we have two coupled bistable sub-systems, each driven separately by an external logic input signal, the coupled system yields outputs that can be mapped to specific logic gate operations in a robust manner, in an optimal window of noise. So, though the individual systems receive only one logic input each, due to the interplay of coupling, nonlinearity and noise, they cooperatively respond to give a logic output that is a function of both inputs. Thus the emergent collective response of the system, due to the inherent coupling, in the presence of a noise floor, maps consistently to that of logic outputs of the two inputs, a phenomenon we term coupling induced Logical Stochastic Resonance. Lastly, we demonstrate our idea in proof of principle circuit experiments.},

  title={Construction of logic gates exploiting resonance phenomena in nonlinear systems},
  abstract={A two-state system driven by two inputs has been found to consistently produce a response mirroring a logic function of the two inputs, in an optimal window of moderate noise. This phenomenon is called logical stochastic resonance (LSR). We extend the conventional LSR paradigm to implement higher-level logic architecture or typical digital electronic structures via carefully crafted coupling schemes. Further, we examine the intriguing possibility of obtaining reliable logic outputs from a noise-free bistable system, subject only to periodic forcing, and show that this system also yields a phenomenon analogous to LSR, termed Logical Vibrational Resonance (LVR), in an appropriate window of frequency and amplitude of the periodic forcing. Lastly, this approach is extended to realize morphable logic gates through the Logical Coherence Resonance (LCR) in excitable systems under the influence of noise. The results are verified with suitable circuit experiments, demonstrating the robustness of the LSR, LVR and LCR phenomena.},

  abstract = {We implement robust logic gates utilizing a second order autonomous memristive circuit in the presence of a noise floor. We find that extremely reliable operations are obtained in an optimal band of moderate noise, with both direct and complementary logic operations obtained in parallel. The system also has the capacity to morph between logic functions efficiently by a simple change of bias, laying the foundation for noise-aided reconfigurable logic gates. Lastly, we implement coupling induced logical stochastic resonance (LSR) on a coupled system of memristors, paving the path for the realization of multi-input logic gates without the need for separate adder circuits. All ideas are demonstrated explicitly through numerical simulations, as well as proof-of-principle circuit experiments. Thus, our results suggest that the memristive circuit offers a promising system to implement robust and flexible logic operations in noisy environments and may help expand the scope of memristive device-based memcomputing.},

  title={Competitive interplay of repulsive coupling and cross-correlated noises in bistable systems},
  author={Aravind, Manaoj and Sinha, Sudeshna and Parmananda, P},
  abstract={The influence of noise on synchronization has potential impact on physical, chemical, biological, and engineered systems. Research on systems subject to common noise has demonstrated that noise can aid synchronization, as common noise imparts correlations on the sub-systems. In our work, we revisit this idea for a system of bistable dynamical systems, under repulsive coupling, driven by noises with varying degrees of cross correlation. This class of coupling has not been fully explored, and we show that it offers new counter-intuitive emergent behavior. Specifically, we demonstrate that the competitive interplay of noise and coupling gives rise to phenomena ranging from the usual synchronized state to the uncommon anti-synchronized state where the coupled bistable systems are pushed to different wells. Interestingly, this progression from anti-synchronization to synchronization goes through a domain where the system randomly hops between the synchronized and anti-synchronized states. The underlying basis for this striking behavior is that correlated noise preferentially enhances coherence, while the interactions provide an opposing drive to push the states apart. Our results also shed light on the robustness of synchronization obtained in the idealized scenario of perfectly correlated noise, as well as the influence of noise correlation on anti-synchronization. Last, the experimental implementation of our model using bistable electronic circuits, where we were able to sweep a large range of noise strengths and noise correlations in the laboratory realization of this noise-driven coupled system, firmly indicates the robustness and generality of our observations.},

  abstract={In this article, we present a dynamical scheme to obtain a reconfigurable noise-aided logic gate that yields all six fundamental two-input logic operations, including the xor operation. The setup consists of two coupled bistable subsystems that are each driven by one subthreshold logic input signal, in the presence of a noise floor. The synchronization state of their outputs robustly maps to two-input logic operations of the driving signals, in an optimal window of noise and coupling strengths. Thus the interplay of noise, nonlinearity, and coupling leads to the emergence of logic operations embedded within the collective state of the coupled system. This idea is manifested using both numerical simulations and proof-of-principle circuit experiments. The regions in parameter space that yield reliable logic operations were characterized through a stringent measure of reliability, using both numerical and experimental data.}

  abstract={In this paper, we introduce a simple controllable experimental system that can exhibit rich dynamics. The setup comprises a sealed glass vial of ethanol with wicks immersed in it. The flame produced by such a lamp can show both steady combustion or oscillatory combustion (i.e. flickering) depending on the volume of fuel within and the number of wicks used in its construction. This tunability makes it a great model system to study the dynamics of flame oscillations and to explore emergent behaviour of coupled nonlinear oscillators in table-top experiments. In the present work, the behaviour of this system for different fuel volumes is explored and some typical phenomena reported in other experimental systems, viz. in-phase synchronization, anti-phase synchronization and amplitude death are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {In this article we experimentally demonstrate an efficient scheme to regulate the behavior of coupled nonlinear oscillators through dynamic control of their interaction. It is observed that introducing intermittency in the interaction term as a function of time or the system state predictably alters the dynamics of the constituent oscillators. Choosing the nature of the interaction, attractive or repulsive, allows for either suppression of oscillations or stimulation of activity. Two parameters Δ and τ, that reign the extent of interaction among subsystems, are introduced. They serve as a harness to access the entire range of possible behaviors from fixed points to chaos. For fixed values of system parameters and coupling strength, changing Δ and τ offers fine control over the dynamics of coupled subsystems. We show this experimentally using coupled Chua's circuits and elucidate their behavior for a range of coupling parameters through detailed numerical simulations.},

We show the occurrence of this phenomenon in a variety of bistable systems including the synthetic genetic network model, in the presence of both uniform and Gaussian noise, indicating the generality of this phenomenon. Further, we experimentally verify the different regimes of behaviour in coupled bistable electronic circuits, thus establishing its robustness.",
