    - <p><em>Application of nonlinearity and emergent phenomena to yield better design.</em></p> <p>My PhD work involved using the interplay of noise and nonlinearity to make better logic gates. At present I study emergent behavior and control of coupled nonlinear systems, using both simulations and experiments.</p> <p>Iâ€™m deeply passionate about using complexity for better computation and most of my work has revolved around that theme. I'm looking for new avenues to expand the scope of my work.</p>
