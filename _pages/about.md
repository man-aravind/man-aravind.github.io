I'm currently a Postdoctoral fellow with [Prof. Punit Parmananda](https://iitb.irins.org/profile/155601)'s lab at the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), where I explore nonlinear phenomena through table-top experiments. I'm deeply passionate about studying the emergent complexity in dynamical systems and harnessing it to yield better design. During my PhD at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) with [Prof. Sudeshna Sinha](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/faculty/dps/sudeshna), I worked on understanding the interplay between noise and nonlinearity in multistable systems to make noise-aided logic gates. 

In general terms, **pursing science beyond curiosity into realizing tangible applications** excites me and I'm on a constant lookout for new themes to broaden my scope of work. 

In addition to science, discussions on language, music and socio-politics engage my interest. I also dabble in writing [Tamil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamil_language) poetry and playing wind instruments on calm days.
