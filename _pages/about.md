I'm currently a Postdoctoral fellow with [Prof. Hildegard Meyer-Ortmanns](https://info.constructor.university/directory/meyer-ortmanns-external)'s group at [Constructor University Bremen](https://constructor.university/). Here, we study coupled heteroclinic networks as models of transient processes in the brain and explore possible computational applications of such systems.  

Previously, at [Prof. Punit Parmananda](https://iitb.irins.org/profile/155601)'s lab in the [Indian Institute of Technology Bombay](https://www.iitb.ac.in/), I explored nonlinear phenomena through table-top experiments. I'm deeply passionate about studying the emergent complexity in dynamical systems and harnessing it to yield better design. During my PhD at [IISER Mohali](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/) with [Prof. Sudeshna Sinha](https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/faculty/dps/sudeshna), I worked on understanding the interplay between noise and nonlinearity in multistable systems to make noise-aided logic gates. 

Broadly, **pursuing science beyond curiosity into realizing tangible applications** excites me and I'm on a constant lookout for new themes to broaden my scope of work. 

In addition to science, discussions on language, music and socio-politics engage my interest. I also dabble in writing [Tamil poetry](https://www.instagram.com/marakkilai/) and playing wind instruments on calm days.
